# Release process

## Manual steps

### Expected artifacts

1. A container image containing the aws-provider manager binary
2. A release tarball containing the manifest-templates and a script to generate
   the actual manifests
3. Release notes

### Output locations

#### Container image

The container image will live in the registry `gcr.io/cluster-api-provider-aws`
under the image name `cluster-api-aws-controller:<tag>` where `<tag>` is
replaced by the version being released.

#### Manifests

Manifests must be generated by hand.

Running `make release-artifacts` will create a tarball that you can attach to
the drafted release.

#### Release Notes

Release notes are written by hand. Generally we'll make a [hackmd](hackmd.io)
and share the release note responsibility. We share it in the kubernetes slack
in the channel #cluster-api-aws.
